UNIT HIDctrlIntf;
{
  USB: Human Interface Device class interface file:
  Basic calls to communicate with an HID device

  When using this unit/library make sure the next "standard"
  Windows DLL's are installed on the target system:
     - HID.DLL
     - SetupAPI.DLL

INTERFACE

CONST
{
  he numberf below indicates the maximum number of HID devices the scan
  function can return.
}
  HIDmaxDevices = 31;

TYPE
{
  Basic HID data buffer. This the maximum size of an HID buffer.
  The actual size for a specific device should be cheched
  before any communication is started
}
  THIDbuffer        = Array[0..63] of Byte;

{
  The interface includes a thread which tries to read data from
  the active HID device. When a callback procdure is assigned in
  the main program, all available data is automatically returned
  to the application in this procedure
}
  THIDcallBack      = Procedure( Data : THIDbuffer); stdcall;

{
  When a USB device is attached or removed from the system, the
  system will generate a message. By specifying a callback procedure
  in the main program, the event can be used to take some action,
  for instance to check if the active device is still present.
}
  TUSBcallBack      = Procedure; stdcall;

{
  An HID device is specified by the structure shown below. Apart from
  the VID/PID combination, the beuffersize is of greate importance
  as that specifies how much data can be transferred in a single vcall.
}
  THIDdeviceInfo = Record
    SymLink            : ShortString;  // symbolic link from registry
    BufferSize         : Word;  // size of the data buffer for sending/receiving data
    Handle             : THandle;  // handle which is returned when device is opened
    VID                : Word;  // Vendor ID code
    PID                : Word;  // Product ID code
    VersionNumber      : Word;  // Vrsion information
    ManufacturerString : ShortString;  // Textual manufacurer information
    ProductString      : ShortString;  // Textual product information
    SerialNumberString : ShortString;  // Textual serial number information
  end;
              
{
  The structure below contains information of all HID devices after a call
  to ScanForHIDdevices.
}
  THIDDeviceList = Array[0..HIDmaxDevices] of THIDdeviceInfo;

{
    assign procedure to call when a usb device is inserted or removed
}
Procedure USBsetEventHandler( Callback : TUSBcallBack);  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  assign a user procedure which will receive data when HID device has send it
}
Procedure HIDsetEventHandler( CallBack : THIDcallback);  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  Scan all available HID Devices.
  When Target VID/PID equal 0 all HID entries from device manager are
  returned. To check the presence of a particular device, enter the
  required VID/PID information
}
Procedure HIDscanForDevices( Var DeviceList : THIDDeviceList;
                             Var NumDevices : Byte;
                                 TargetVID,
                                 TargetPID  : Word);  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  Get a Handle to the device (open it)
}
Function HIDopenDevice( Var DeviceInfo : THIDdeviceInfo) : Boolean;  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  Close Device
}
Function HIDcloseDevice( Var DeviceInfo : THIDdeviceInfo) : Boolean;  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  Write NrOfBytes to HID device
}
Function HIDwriteDevice( Var DeviceInfo   : THIDdeviceInfo;
                             Data         : THIDbuffer): Boolean;  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';

{
  Read data from device with a time-out.
  When succesfull NrOfBytes holds the actual number of bytes
}
Function HIDreadDevice( Var DeviceInfo : THIDdeviceInfo;
                        Var Data       : THIDbuffer ) : Boolean;  stdcall;  External 'HIDcontrol.dll';
